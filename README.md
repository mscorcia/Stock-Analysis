# Stock-Analysis

## Overview

Steve is an investor and his parents are requesting that their funds be invested into DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company that makes silicon wafers on solar panels. Although this is a great plan, Steve believes it will be in his parents best interest to diversify their portfolio; where their funds are distributed into other alternative enery companies that specialize in hydroelectricity, wind, geothermal, and bio energy.  Our goal as a data analyst is to determine which stocks will offer the best return between the years 2017 and 2018.

## Results

Based on my analysis, the ENPH and RUN stocks has shown positive returns during the years 2017 and 2018 with high daily volume trading.  With high daily volume trading stocks Steve's parents will be able to convert their asset into cash more easily than stocks with low daily volume trading.  Based on this information, Steve will be investing his parents funds into these stocks because they offer positive returns, and mostly advise his parents that the DAQO company stock is not the best option because it has shown a negative return in 2018.

## Summary

The advantage in refactoring code is that it allows you to improve the efficiency and speed at which the code executes the task. The disadvantage is that it may delay the overall project and decisione needed to be made in a short deadline. Also, it may introduce errors.   

With regards to this project, refactoring was necessary to achieve Steve's goal in optimizing the return of his parent's investments.  Without refactoring the code, the code would have not been able to analyze the data and report the information that Steve needed to make his decision on what stocks to invest his parents funds.
